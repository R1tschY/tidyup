tidyup
======

Little python script that remove backup files (configurable through unix shell-style wildcards),
files generated by `Makefile`s and `automake`.

Requires:

  Python >= 3.0

  Make (optional)

Description
-----------

The Script is looking for files and directories match on of the pattern passed over
console arguments or given in a file `.tidyup` placed in the directory to by
cleaned up. Is a `configure` script and a `Makefile` placed in one directory,
`make distclean` will be executed. Is in one directory only a `Makefile` then
`make clean` will be executed.

By default a backup archive will created with the name `tidyup.backup.tar.gz` or a name
given in the `backup` argument (`.tar.gz` will be appended to this name).
In the backup archive all files will be placed that match one of the pattern
(No files removed by `make distclean` or `make clean` are part of the archive).

Examples
--------

Cleanup music directory:

    tidyup.py --pattern desktop.ini/Thumbs.db/AlbumArt*.jpg ~/Music
  
Extract JPEG images and save to ~/images.tar.gz:

    tidyup.py --backup ~/images --pattern *.jpg/*.JPG
  
Remove common backup files without moving to a backup archive:

    tidyup.py --no-backup --pattern *~/*.bak
